## 💼 What Does It Do?

🌀 **Super Transformer** takes your raw, structured data (like Parquet files) and transforms it into something usable. Whether you’re working with cloud data, local files, or complex formats, this tool is built to handle them all. It’s all about transforming messy data into a format that can be easily processed or analyzed.

### 🚀 Features

- 🛠 **Parquet Parsing**: Seamless Parquet-to-Go struct transformation. No more Parquet headaches!
- 🎛 **Flexible Transformation**: Handles different data formats & provides custom transformations.
- 💨 **Fast and Efficient**: Optimized for performance with Go's concurrency model.
- 🤖 **CLI Interface**: Use it right from your terminal with a snazzy command line interface.
- 🔄 **Format Extensibility**: Support for adding other formats (future-proof!).

## 🏗️ Getting Started

### 📦 Installation

First things first, clone the repo and install dependencies:

### 🎮 Running the Transformer

After installation, you can run the transformer like this:

```

If you want to transform a Parquet file:

## 🤓 Example Usage

Let’s transform some Parquet data into JSON with just one command:

```bash

```

BOOM! 💥 Your data is ready in seconds.

```bash
go test ./...
```

Results looking good? 🍻 Now you can brag about it!
